## FavGiphy

This project was developed for a summer internship application challenge. 
[Live Demo](https://favgiphy.netlify.com/)

The objective of the project was to develop a Single Page Application with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).
The requested features were:
 - [X] Use of [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/) to get the Gifs;
 - [X] Search of gifs based on user input, using the API;
 - [X] Favourite gifs;
 - [X] List the favourite gifs;
 - [X] Favourites must persist between sessions.
 
 ## Setup
 
 Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.
 Clone this repository, cd into it and run:
 
 ```shell
 npm start
 ```
 ## Implemented Features
 
* Favourite and Unfavourite of Gifs, using sweet animations:
* Routing to the Feed and Favourites pages:

 ## Possible Improvements
 
 These are the improvements I intend to work on before the project's due date, if time suffices: 
 - [ ] Implement lazy loading on Gifs.
 - [ ] Use routing on search so that searched pages can be accessed by URL (example: /search?=magic ).
 - [ ] Sticky navbar featuring the 'Feed' and 'Favorites' endpoints.
 - [ ] Documentation, although the code was written so it is easily understood (using comments whenever it may be more complicated).
 
 ## Possible Improvements according to the evaluators:
 - [ ] No feedback when a gif is added.
 - [ ] Gifs' fram rate is unnecessarily low.
 - [ ] It is not easy to understand in which tab we are located in ( Feed or Favorites ) 
 
 ## Extra: Learning React
 
 To learn the basics of React I used [freeCodeCamp's tutorial on React](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react).
 It explains the basics extremelly well and helped me a lot at getting to understand it!
