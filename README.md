## FavGiphy

This project was developed for a summer internship application challenge.

The objective of the project was to develop a single page app with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).
The requested features were:
 - [X] Use of [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/) to get the Giphs;
 - [X] Search of giphs based on user input, using the API;
 - [X] Favourite giphs;
 - [X] List the favourite giphs;
 - [X] Favourites must persist between sessions.
 
 ## Set-up
 
 Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.
 Clone this repository, cd into it and run:
 
 ```shell
 npm start
 ```
 #### OR
 
 Check the [website](https://favgiphy.netlify.com/) deployed using [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
 
 ## Implemented Features

 ## Possible Improvements
 
 These are the improvements I intend to work on, if I have the time to, until the delivery of the project:
 - [ ] Implement lazy loading on Giphs.
 - [ ] Use routing on search so that searched pages can be accessed by URL (example: /search?=magic ).
 - [ ] Navbar that upon the initial scrolling stays stick on top of the page, with 'Feed' and 'Favorites' buttons inside.
 - [ ] Documentation, although the code was written so it is easily understood (usign comments whenever it may be more complicated).
 
 ## Extra: Learning React
 
 To learn the basics from React I used [freeCodeCamp tutorial on React](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react).
 It explains the basics of React extremelly well and helped me a lot at getting to understand it!
